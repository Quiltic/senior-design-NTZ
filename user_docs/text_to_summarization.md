## Text to Summarization ##
The second module of P.A.N.T.S. is summarization of text. As shown in [overview](user_docs/overview),
you may summarize text files without a source video or audio file. Doing so will skip to the summariztion module immediately.

The file's text should be formatted in the same way it is usually transcribed. The summarization module takes formatted text, finds relevent and important
information and outputs a bulleted list.
