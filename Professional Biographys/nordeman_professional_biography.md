# Professional Biography
Presently, I am a fifth-year senior at the University of Cincinnati pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my time in University, in the classroom, I have gained exposure to data structures, encryption and security methods, and front and back end development. I completed 3 co-op rotations at Siemens Digital Industries Software in Milford, Ohio. While here, I focused primarily on back-end development and technologies including Mendix, GraphQL, JavaScript, and C++. I most recently completed 2 consecutive rotations as a data engineering co-op at 84.51 in Cincinnati, Ohio. I gained experience in Grafana, Snowflake, Automic, and PySpark while helping to build and automate data pipelines.
