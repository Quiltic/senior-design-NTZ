-In the early universe, there was only hydrogen and helium
-As the universe cooled, hydrogen atoms formed
-These atoms then combined to form stars
-As stars burned, they produced heavier elements
-Some of these elements were ejected into space when the star exploded
-These elements then combined to form new stars and planets
-The elements on Earth were formed in this way
-The heavier elements are found in the cores of stars and planets
-The lighter elements are found in the outer layers of stars and planets
