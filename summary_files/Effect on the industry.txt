-There are a few things you can do to make sure you get a good night's sleep:
-First, avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. Both of these can make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep.
-Second, create a bedtime routine that includes winding down for at least 30 minutes before sleep. This can mean reading, taking a bath, or listening to calming music.
-Third, make sure your sleeping environment is dark, quiet, and cool. This will help your body reach the optimal sleep temperature and minimize distractions.
-Fourth, get up and move around during the day. Exercise can help improve your sleep quality by making you tired at night.
-Finally, if you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get up and do something else until you feel tired again. Trying to force yourself to sleep will only make it harder.
