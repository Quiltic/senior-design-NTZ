-Dalton's theory was able to explain the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy
-The modern atomic theory builds on Dalton's work and states that atoms are composed of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, with electrons orbiting around the nucleus
-The number of protons in an atom determines the element, and the number of electrons determines the chemical properties of an element
