-The scientific method is a systematic process for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, or correcting and integrating previous knowledge.
-The scientific method is characterized by its use of empiricism, experimentation, and hypotheses.
-The scientific method typically begins with observations or measurements of a phenomenon.
-These observations or measurements are then used to form a hypothesis, which is a testable statement about the phenomenon.
-The hypothesis is then subjected to experimentation or other forms of testing.
-Based on the results of the testing, the hypothesis is either supported or rejected.
-If the hypothesis is supported, it may be further refined or expanded.
-If the hypothesis is rejected, a new hypothesis may be formulated and tested.
-The scientific method is an iterative process, and the results of one experiment can be used to inform subsequent experiments.
-The glass ceiling is a metaphor used to describe the invisible barrier that limits women's advancement in the workplace.

-The glass ceiling is a barrier to women's advancement in the workplace that is often invisible and hard to identify.

-Breaking the glass ceiling requires women to be assertive and confident in their abilities, and to demand equality in the workplace.
