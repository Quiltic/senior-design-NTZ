-The glass ceiling is a term that is used to describe the unseen, and often unspoken, barrier that keeps women from advancing in the workplace.
-The term was first coined in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and has been used in reference to the barriers women face in both the private and public sector.
-Despite the progress that has been made in recent years, the glass ceiling remains a reality for many women in the workforce.
-There are a number of factors that contribute to the existence of the glass ceiling, including gender-based discrimination, the lack of flexible work arrangements, and the prevalence of the "old boys' club" mentality in many organizations.
-Overcoming the glass ceiling requires a concerted effort on the part of both women and men. Women need to be aware of the barriers that exist and be willing to fight for their right to advance in the workplace. Men need to be allies in this effort, and work to create a more level playing field for all employees.
