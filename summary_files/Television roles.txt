-The doctor may order a computed tomography (CT) scan to check for an aneurysm or other problems.
-Aneurysms are most commonly found in the aorta, the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.
-Aneurysms can be treated with surgery, but if they are not caught early, they can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding.
-If an aneurysm is found, the doctor will likely order an angiogram to get a better look at the blood vessels.
-An angiogram is a test that uses X-rays and a special dye to see the blood vessels.
-The doctor may also order an echocardiogram to check for heart problems.
-An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart.
-The doctor may also order blood tests to check for problems with the liver or kidneys.
-The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has issued a final rule to update its recordkeeping regulation to improve worker safety and health.

-The rule will improve OSHA's ability to collect data on workplace injuries and illnesses, identify and investigate safety and health hazards, and implement and evaluate effectiveness of injury and illness prevention programs.
-The rule will also help OSHA identify emerging safety and health trends, and provide information to employers and workers about effective injury and illness prevention programs.
-The rule will become effective on January 1, 2017.
