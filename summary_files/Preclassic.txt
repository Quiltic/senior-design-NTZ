-In the early universe, there was only hydrogen and helium
-Stars formed from the gravitational collapse of hydrogen and helium gas
-Star formation continued until the present day
-The first stars were very massive and short-lived
-The first stars ionized the hydrogen in the universe
-The first stars ended their lives as supernovae
-The elements created in the first stars were dispersed into the universe
-Subsequent generations of stars were formed from this enriched gas
-The elements created in subsequent generations of stars include carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen
-The life cycles of stars depend on their mass
-The most massive stars live the shortest lives and end their lives as supernovae
-The least massive stars live the longest lives and end their lives as white dwarfs
-Intermediate-mass stars end their lives as planetary nebulae
-The elements created in supernovae are dispersed into the universe
-Subsequent generations of stars are formed from this enriched gas
-The elements created in subsequent generations of stars include iron, silicon, and magnesium
-The life cycles of stars are affected by their environments
-Binary stars interact with each other and can exchange mass
-The most massive stars are found in the centers of galaxies
-The least massive stars are found in the outskirts of galaxies
-Intermediate-mass stars are found in both the centers and the outskirts of galaxies
-The following is a list of bullet points detailing what was discussed in the meeting:
-The team discussed the current status of the project and what still needs to be done
-They also went over the timeline for the project and what needs to be completed by when
-The team then went over the budget for the project and what expenses still need to be covered
-Lastly, they discussed the marketing plan for the project and how they will promote it
