-The Gilded Age was a time of great corruption in American politics, with many politicians catering to business interests in exchange for support and wealth.
-This era was also marked by a lack of clear mandates from the public, which made presidents hesitant to pursue any ambitious agendas.
-As a result, for nearly a quarter of a century, presidents had very little power and legislators were reluctant to tie their own agendas to the whims of such weak leaders.
-The desires of businessmen and industrialists led to corruption in politics
-This corruption led to a lack of progress on the federal level
-The election of 1876 was controversial, with both parties claiming to be for reform
-The campaign was typical for the era, with each party attacking the other
-The Redshirts were a Republican-led paramilitary group in the late 1800s that used violence to restore Democrats to power in the South
-The Redshirts would attack freedmen who attempted to vote, and also held barbecues to attract Democratic voters
-Women throughout South Carolina sewed red flannel shirts for the men to wear, and also wore red ribbons in their hair
-The election of 1876 was close, with Tilden winning the popular vote but not the electoral vote
-The House of Representatives established a special electoral commission to determine which candidate won the disputed electoral votes of three states
-The Compromise of 1877 was reached, in which Hayes would order the withdrawal of troops from three southern states in exchange for the control of the election
-Hayes defeated Tilden in the electoral vote by a count of 185-184, and became president
-Radical Reconstruction ended, with Democrats regaining control of the South
-The compromise was seen as unpopular among African Americans, who referred to it as "The Great Betrayal"
-The two major political parties remained largely indistinguishable in their agendas as well as their propensity for questionable tactics and backroom deals
-In the 24 years following the Civil War, there was no incumbent president that was re-elected
-This was due to the fact that the populace preferred the devil they didn't know to the one they did
-During this era, presidents had to spend their four years in office repaying favors and managing relationships that got them into the White House
-The main issue that presidents addressed during this time was political patronage
-This allowed those with political influence to ascend to powerful positions within the government, regardless of their level of experience or skill
-A movement emerged during this time in support of reforming the practice of political appointments
-Despite this, very little was accomplished in terms of reform
-Two powerful Republican leaders attempted to control President Hayes during this time: Roscoe Conkling and James G. Blaine
-The "Half-Breeds" were a group of Republicans who advocated for civil service reform during President Hayes' administration.
-Chester A. Arthur was a Stalwart who was removed from his position as head of the New York City Customs House by President Hayes.
-The Compromise of 1877 and the loss of Congressional support led to President Hayes' failure to win reelection.
-In the 1880 presidential election, the Republican Party nominated James A. Garfield as their candidate.
-Garfield won a narrow victory over Winfield Scott Hancock, the Democratic candidate.
-Charles Guiteau shot and killed Garfield, leading to more urgent cries for civil service reform.
-Chester Arthur, who became president after Garfield's death, signed the Pendleton Civil Service Act into law in 1883.
-The United States Tariff Commission was created in 1882 to investigate the propriety of increasingly high tariffs.
-The "Mongrel Tariff" of 1883 lowered tariff rates by barely 5 percent.
-The Republican Party was unable to find a candidate who could restore some semblance of the spoils system while maintaining a reformist image, so they nominated Senator Blaine.
-The Democratic Party chose to court the Mugwump vote by nominating Grover Cleveland, the reform governor from New York.
-Cleveland was a notable reform president in terms of business regulation and tariffs.
-The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 created the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to oversee railroad prices and ensure that they remained reasonable to all customers.
-The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1886 that individual states could not regulate interstate transportation.
-In the late 1800s, the US economy was booming, but farmers and working-class Americans were struggling with high costs and low wages
-The Republican Party nominated Benjamin Harrison for president in 1888, and he won on a platform of higher tariffs and a return to the spoils system
-Harrison's policies were largely ineffective in helping average Americans, and his commitment to the gold standard left many farmers and working-class Americans in debt
-In 1892, farmers and working-class Americans formed the Populist Party in an attempt to take control of the political process and enact policies that would help them
-Many American farmers faced significant challenges in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, including economic hardships, overproduction, and prohibitively high tariffs.
-One of the largest challenges farmers faced was overproduction, which drove prices lower and made it difficult for farmers to earn a living.
-In addition to overproduction, tariffs were a serious problem for farmers. Rising tariffs on industrial products made purchased items more expensive, yet tariffs were not being used to keep farm prices artificially high.
-Finally, the issue of gold versus silver as the basis of U.S. currency was a very real problem to many farmers. Farmers needed more money in circulation, whether it was paper or silver, in order to create inflationary pressure.
-The initial response by increasingly frustrated and angry farmers was to organize into groups that were similar to early labor unions. One of the first efforts to organize farmers came in 1867 with Oliver Hudson Kelly’s creation of the Patrons of Husbandry, more popularly known as the Grange.
-The Grange quickly grew to over 1.5 million members in less than a decade and succeeded in urging the passage of Granger Laws, which regulated some railroad rates and grain elevator prices.
- In 1886, the US Supreme Court ruled against the state of Illinois for passing Granger Laws controlling railroad rates, finding such laws to be unconstitutional. - In 1890, the Farmers' Alliance was formed by a conglomeration of three regional alliances. - The Farmers' Alliance had several goals, including greater regulation of railroad prices and the creation of an inflationary national monetary policy. - The most creative solution promoted by the Farmers' Alliance was the call for a subtreasury plan. - Under the subtreasury plan, the federal government would store farmers' crops in government warehouses for a brief period of time and provide loans to farmers worth 80 percent of the current crop prices. - The government's refusal to act on the proposal left many farmers wondering what it would take to find solutions to their growing problems.
-The Farmers' Alliance formed the Populist Party in 1891 in order to address the plight of farmers and enact real change.
-The Populist Party had modest success in electing state legislators, one governor, and a handful of congressmen in nonpresidential-year elections.
-The Populists chose to model themselves after the Democratic and Republican Parties in the hope of shocking the country with a "third-party" victory in the 1892 presidential election.
-The Populists wrote the Omaha Platform, which vilified railroad owners, bankers, and big businessmen as part of a conspiracy to control farmers, and called for policy changes such as the adoption of the subtreasury plan and government control over railroads.
-Despite their best efforts, the Populists did not win the 1892 presidential election, but received a respectable one million votes.
-The Populists hoped that the 1896 presidential election would be more successful, as they believed that the country's industrial workers would be more receptive to their message if they were experiencing similar economic hardships as farmers.
-The following was built on a bubble: When the railroads began to fail due to expenses outpacing returns on their construction, the supporting businesses, from banks to steel mills, failed also.
-Beginning with the closure of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company in 1893, several railroads ceased their operations as a result of investors cashing in their bonds, thus creating a ripple effect throughout the economy.
-In a single year, from 1893 to 1894, unemployment estimates increased from 3 percent to nearly 19 percent of all working-class Americans.
-At the height of this depression, over three million American workers were unemployed.
-Immediately following the economic downturn, people sought relief through their elected federal government. Just as quickly, they learned what farmers had been taught in the preceding decades: A weak, inefficient government interested solely in patronage and the spoils system in order to maintain its power was in no position to help the American people face this challenge.
-A notable example of the government’s failure to act was the story of Coxey’s Army.
-In the spring of 1894, businessman Jacob Coxey led a march of unemployed Ohioans from Cincinnati to Washington, DC, where leaders of the group urged Congress to pass public works legislation for the federal government to hire unemployed workers to build roads and other public projects.
-From the original one hundred protesters, the march grew five hundred strong as others joined along the route to the nation’s capital. Upon their arrival, not only were their cries for federal relief ignored, but Coxey and several other marchers were arrested for trespassing on the grass outside the U.S. Capitol.
-Frustration over the event led many angry workers to consider supporting the Populist Party in subsequent elections.
-Several strikes also punctuated the growing depression, including a number of violent uprisings in the coal regions of Ohio and Pennsylvania.
-But the infamous Pullman Strike of 1894 was most notable for its nationwide impact, as it all but shut down the nation’s railroad system in the middle of the depression.
-The strike began immediately on the heels of the Coxey’s Army march when, in the summer of 1894, company owner George Pullman fired over two thousand employees at Pullman Co.—which made railroad cars, such as Pullman sleeper cars—and reduced the wages of the remaining three thousand workers.
-Since the factory operated in the company town of Pullman, Illinois, where workers rented homes from George Pullman and shopped at the company store owned by him as well, unemployment also meant eviction.
-Facing such harsh treatment, all of the Pullman workers went on strike to protest the decisions.
-Eugene V. Debs, head of the American Railway Union, led the strike.
-In order to bring the plight of Pullman, Illinois, to Americans all around the country, Debs adopted the strike strategy of ordering all American Railroad Union members to refuse to handle any train that had Pullman cars on it.
-Since virtually every train in the United States operated with Pullman cars, the strike truly brought the transportation industry to its knees.
-Fearful of his ability to end the economic depression with such a vital piece of the economy at a standstill, President Cleveland turned to his attorney general for the answer.
-The attorney general proposed a solution: use federal troops to operate the trains under the pretense of protecting the delivery of the U.S. mail that was typically found on all
-The American Railway Union was destroyed by the government during a strike, leaving workers even worse off and Debs in prison.
-The Populist Party was gaining steam heading into the 1896 election, with many Americans disillusioned by the state of the economy.
-The Populists considered William Jennings Bryan to be their ideal candidate, but he was nominated by the Democrats instead.
-The Populists ultimately endorsed Bryan but ran their own vice presidential candidate in an attempt to keep their party identity.
-The election was close, with McKinley winning by a slim margin. Bryan's campaign was impressive, winning more votes than any other losing candidate in history.
-The Populist Party was effectively ended by William McKinley's victory in the 1896 US Presidential Election.
-The Populists had thrown their support to the Democrats, who shared similar ideas for the country's economic rebound.
-In choosing principle over distinct party identity, the Populists aligned themselves to the growing two-party American political system.
-Future efforts to establish a separate party identity would be met with ridicule by critics.
-Other factors that contributed to the decline of Populism include the discovery of vast gold deposits in Alaska and the impending Spanish-American War.
