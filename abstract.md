    Whether a course is being taught, taken, or evaluated, it is highly beneficial to have a readable, searchable transcript on-hand, as well as an abstract overview of the material. Our project will accurately capture lecture recording audio, transcribe it to raw text, and create a summary of important, relevant information for later reference. One of the major project aims is to make lectures more accessible to students with disabilities that may prevent them from taking notes. This project will likely be completed using Python and Python libraries PyTorch, Torchaudio, as well as Selenium, and will be designed for use with prerecorded video lectures.
