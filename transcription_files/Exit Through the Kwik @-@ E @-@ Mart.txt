Churchill 's subjects are often American Indian figures and other themes associated with Native American Culture . He uses historical photographs as source material for works . In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market , Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act . It requires that , to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American , artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan . Under federal law , Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American .Some of Churchill 's pieces may infringe copyrights . For example , his 1981 serigraph Winter Attack was , according to Churchill and others , based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. Mails Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them . Other copies are available online for purchase . Churchill says that , when he produced Winter Attack , he publicly acknowledged that it was based on Mails ' work . The online journal Artnet mentions Churchill 's artwork and the controversy surrounding its originality .
