On November 13 , 2012 , the spokesperson of the Prague State Attorney 's Office announced that the police had formally closed their investigation and proposed to the State Attorney to indict Blythe . After reviewing the case file , the State Attorney indicted Blythe on the aforementioned charges on November 30 , 2012 . Two weeks later , a judge set the trial to commence on February 4 , 2013 , with a plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days . Blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person .The case was heard by a panel of the Prague Municipal Court , consisting of presiding professional judge Tomáš Kubovec and two lay judges . Trials in the Czech Republic are public . In general , the court is bound to decide on the deed as stated in the indictment ; however , it is not bound by its legal assessment by the State Attorney .Both the defendant and the State Attorney may appeal the decision ; the appeal would be heard by a panel of the Prague High Court , consisting of three professional judges . A decision of second instance court is final and enforceable . Nevertheless , an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the Supreme State Attorney , which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in Brno ; an extraordinary appeal may , however , rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case . After exhausting all of these remedies , the defendant may also lodge a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic . The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms .
