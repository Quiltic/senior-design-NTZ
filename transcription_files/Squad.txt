The tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand . It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the Southern Hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport . By the time the Natives returned to New Zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations . Seventeen of the 26 players went on to play provincially in New Zealand , and two , Ellison and David Gage , subsequently captained New Zealand .The tour also prompted the eventual formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( NZRFU , later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union ) in 1892 ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides . The NZRFU sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team , captained by Ellison , to tour Australia in 1893 . The Natives are also the forefathers of the Māori All Blacks , a representative team organised by the NZRFU , that first played in 1910 . The Native team , along with Joe Warbrick , was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2008 – the seventh inductee .
