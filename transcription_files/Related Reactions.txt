The development of an enantioselective Nazarov cyclization is a desirable addition to the repertoire of Nazarov cyclization reactions . To that end , several variations have been developed utilizing chiral auxiliaries and chiral catalysts . Diastereoselective cyclizations are also known , in which extant stereocenters direct the cyclization . Almost all of the attempts are based on the idea of torquoselectivity ; selecting one direction for the vinyl groups to " rotate " in turn sets the stereochemistry as shown below .Silicon @-@ directed Nazarov cyclizations can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way . In the example below , the silyl @-@ group acts to direct the cyclization by preventing the distant alkene from rotating " towards " it via unfavorable steric interaction . In this way the silicon acts as a traceless auxiliary . ( The starting material is not enantiopure but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the cyclization . )Tius 's allenyl substrates can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used . The example below generates a chiral diosphenpol in 64 % yield and 95 % enantiomeric excess .Tius has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based auxiliary for achiral allenes that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of roseophilin . The key step employs an unusual mixture of hexafluoro @-@ 2 @-@ propanol and trifluoroethanol as solvent .The first chiral Lewis acid promoted asymmetric Nazarov cyclization was reported by Varinder Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II ) bisoxazoline ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee . The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 mol % of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased .
