The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s . By then , the Song were on the ropes , and Emperor Kublai Khan , who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions . In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute . The tribute he demanded was nominal . Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan . At the border , the ruler of the Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols .When the Mongol envoys led by Qidai Tuoyin showed up , the Pagan court led by Chief Minister Ananda Pyissi was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King Narathihapate to use diplomacy . The king was furious at the demand and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks . The court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . Accompanying them was a Burmese envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king 's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing . The king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious borderland regions in April 1272 . The rebel leader A @-@ Pi ( အပိ ) was brought back to Pagan . Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action .
