" Where the Streets Have No Name " is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute . The introduction and outro are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 signature . The songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with chorale @-@ like sustained synthesiser notes . The guitar fades in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated " chiming " six @-@ note arpeggio . A " dotted eighth " delay effect is used to " play " each note in the arpeggio twice , thus creating a rich sound . The bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 .The introduction , following a I – IV – I – IV – vi – V – I chord progression , creates a " wall of sound " , as described by Mark Butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes . The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge strumming percussive sixteenth notes . The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while Bono 's vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its timbre , ( " he sighs ; he moans ; he grunts ; he exhales audibly ; he allows his voice to crack " ) as well as timing by his usage of rubato to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat .This development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line " burning down love " ( A – G – F ♯ – D ) ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the A4 at " burning " . In later choruses , Bono sings " blown by the wind " with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer . After the third chorus , the song 's outro is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six @-@ note guitar arpeggio played against sustained synthesiser notes .
