On March 5 , 2013 , the court delivered a verdict , according to which Blythe was not criminally liable for Nosek 's death , even though he had the moral responsibility for it . Consequently , the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe 's bail .The court held that it was proven that Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage . However , Blythe , due to his nearsightedness , could have mistaken Nosek for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the guardrail . According to the court , the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members . Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe for not having met with the Nosek family .The State Attorney announced that he would appeal the verdict .
