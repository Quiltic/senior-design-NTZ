There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan 's Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) . A third bridge added to the NRHP in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT 's listing however . The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . The original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) spandrel arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191 . The structure was listed on the NRHP on December 9 , 1999 , for its architectural and engineering significance .In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the Menominee River northwest of Iron Mountain . The structure is a single @-@ span , pin @-@ connected , camelback , through @-@ truss bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan . It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing . The span cost $ 5 @,@ 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties . Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the Menominee River . In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971 , and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012 .In 2003 , MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in Waucedah Township , Dickinson County . As of October 2011 , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list . It was built in 1929 .Before 1983 , US 2 used a different routing through Manistique and crossed the Manistique River on what is nicknamed the " Siphon Bridge " . Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface . This produces a siphon effect , giving the bridge its nickname . The Manistique Pulp and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the Manistique River to supply their mill . This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction . Instead of expensive dikes , a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man @-@ made banks higher than the natural banks . The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having " concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , [ that ] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . " The Manistique Tourism Council stated : " At one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was atmospherically forced under it , " and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! . The eight @-@ span structure is 294 feet ( 90 m ) long .The Cut River Bridge carries US 2 across the Cut River in Hendricks Township , Mackinac County . This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war @-@ induced steel shortages . The span uses 888 short tons ( 793 long tons ; 806 t ) of structural steel to bridge the 641 feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its gorge at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m ) above the river . The Cut River Bridge is one of only two cantilevered deck truss bridges in the state . On either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river .Listed on the NRHP on December 17 , 1999 , the Mackinac Trail – Carp River Bridge carries H @-@ 63 , the modern successor to US 2 , over the Carp River north of St. Ignace . The bridge is another spandrel arch structure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in length and built in 1920 . Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to " widen its deck by five feet [ 1 @.@ 5 m ] and install new guardrails in the 1929 – 1930 biennium " along with the addition of decorative retaining walls .The last of the historic bridges along a former segment of US 2 is the structure carrying Ashmun Street ( BS I ‑ 75 ) over the Power Canal in Sault Ste . Marie . Built in 1934 , it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state . The 42 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 13 m ) and 257 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 78 m ) structure is described by MDOT as " massive " with an " innovative " construction method : the previous structure was used as a falsework for the current bridge before removal .
