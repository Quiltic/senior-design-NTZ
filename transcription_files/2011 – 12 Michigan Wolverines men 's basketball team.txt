Capel Lligwy has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building â€“ the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 2 September 1952 and has been listed because it is " important as a substantially 12th @-@ century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period " , even though it is now in a " ruinous condition " . Cadw ( which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the " unusual 16th @-@ century vaulted south chapel " .The 19th @-@ century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey . She said that the architecture was of " the rudest kind , [ which ] bears testimony to its great antiquity . " She recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , " containing several human skeletons , which crumbled into dust , when exposed to the air " . She added that further exploration of the vault then revealed " a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth " .A 1990 book about abandoned churches in Wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of Anglesey , and calls Capel Lligwy a " medieval gesture of Christian power in a land so obviously imbued with the spirit of a pagan past " . It notes that " the wheel has turned full circle and Capel Lligwy today is just another ruined relic of a former age . " The authors describe the chapel as a " simple , square building " with a " small and ruggedly austere south chapel " , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are " almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape .
