The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between Ironwood and Sault Ste . Marie . The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of Saranac . When the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 partially replaced M @-@ 12 . Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain , US 2 was routed through Florence , Wisconsin . The former routing of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to Sagola became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became US 102 ( now US 141 ) . M ‑ 12 from Sagola south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M ‑ 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 . By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added along US 2 from Rexton to Garnet as part of a larger extension .The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown Escanaba . A larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste . Marie . The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste . Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation . Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934 . Downtown Ironwood was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 .The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the routings and designations of the highways around Cooks , Thompson and Manistique in the mid @-@ 1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between Cooks and M ‑ 149 in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control . The section between M ‑ 149 and M ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of M ‑ 149 to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ 149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 .The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time . Between Brevort and Moran , US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula . The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace . US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M ‑ 122 . Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls .Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941 . The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette . The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet . From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency . Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M ‑ 117 . The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II .The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s . M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at Ironwood from its western terminus at Wakefield . A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to Sault Ste . Marie in 1948 . The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 . The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 .
