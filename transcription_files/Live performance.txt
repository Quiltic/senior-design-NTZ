Starr recorded a new version of " Back Off Boogaloo " for his 1981 album on Boardwalk Records , Stop and Smell the Roses . The song was produced by Starr 's friend , singer Harry Nilsson , and features a musical arrangement by Van Dyke Parks . Similar to Nilsson 's 1968 cover of the Beatles ' " You Can 't Do That " , the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band 's songs – in this case , " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Help ! " , " Lady Madonna " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " , as well as Starr 's " It Don 't Come Easy " . In a further reference to his past , the 1981 version of " Back Off Boogaloo " opens with the same guitar riff that Harrison had played on " It Don 't Come Easy " ten years before .Starr taped the basic track at Evergreen Recording Studios in Los Angeles on 4 November 1980 , with additional recording taking place on 1 – 5 December at Nassau 's Compass Point Studios . Among the large cast of musicians supporting Starr were Nilsson ( vocals ) , Jim Keltner ( drums ) , Jane Getz ( piano ) , Dennis Budimir and Richie Zito ( guitars ) , and a four @-@ piece horn section led by saxophonist Jerry Jumonville .Starr overdubbed his vocals on 4 December , four days before the murder of John Lennon , who had been due to record his contributions to Stop and Smell the Roses in January 1981 . Contrasting with his success as a solo artist in 1971 – 73 , the album continued Starr 's run of commercial and critical failures since 1976 ; Rodriguez writes that " [ m ] ost people either love or hate the revamping " of " Back Off Boogaloo " .
