By the 7th century , there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700 . Even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style . Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I and his heir Yik 'in Chan K 'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal , extending as far as the territory around Lake Petén Itzá . These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today .In 738 , Quiriguá , a vassal of Copán , Tikal 's key ally in the south , switched allegiance to Calakmul , defeated Copán and gained its own independence . It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal 's southern allies . This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán .In the 8th century , the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis . By the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at Tikal slowed . Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers .
