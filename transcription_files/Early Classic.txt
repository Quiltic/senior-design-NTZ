There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC , in the Middle Preclassic . A cache of Mamon ceramics dating from about 700 @-@ 400 BC were found in a sealed chultun , a subterranean bottle @-@ shaped chamber .Major construction at Tikal was already taking place in the Late Preclassic period , first appearing around 400 – 300 BC , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe . At this time , Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire Yucatan Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize .Two temples dating to Late Chikanel times had masonry @-@ walled superstructures that may have been corbel @-@ vaulted , although this has not been proven . One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a scrollwork background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red .In the 1st century AD rich burials first appeared and Tikal underwent a political and cultural florescence as its giant northern neighbors declined . At the end of the Late Preclassic , the Izapan style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence Tikal , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the acropolis and early murals at the city .
