Once the cyclization has occurred , an oxyallyl cation is formed . As discussed extensively above , the typical course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization . However , these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles , respectively . Oxyallyl cation trapping has been developed extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field . The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with heteroatom and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners . Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity .Enolate trapping with various electrophiles is decidedly less common . In one study , the Nazarov cyclization is paired with a Michael reaction using an iridium catalyst to initiate nucleophilic conjugate addition of the enolate to Î² @-@ nitrostyrene . In this tandem reaction the iridium catalyst is required for both conversions : it acts as the Lewis acid in the Nazarov cyclization and in the next step the nitro group of nitrostyrene first coordinates to iridium in a ligand exchange with the carbonyl ester oxygen atom before the actual Michael addition takes place to the opposite face of the R @-@ group .
