The windmill at Thelnetham was built by millwright George Bloomfield for William Button in 1819 . It replaced a post mill which had been moved to Sandy Lane , Diss , Norfolk the previous year . The mill was set to work on Christmas Day 1819 . In 1832 , the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast @-@ iron windshaft , Patent sails and a fantail . The new windshaft was fitted on 16 July 1832 . It was made by J Aickman , the Kings Lynn millwright , and weighs 1 ¾ tons ( 1 @,@ 780 kg ) . A new stock was fitted in September 1836 . William Button died on 11 February 1837 . The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard . Richard Button worked the mill until 1860 , at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William , who sold it to Richard Peverett from Kenninghall , Norfolk in 1862 .The mill was worked by Stephen Peverett , Richard 's son . He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879 . In 1884 , the mill was sold by auction , and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold . Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill . From 1892 , a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power , driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor . This was replaced in 1914 by a Hornsby oil engine . Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent , a retired millwright from Garboldisham , Norfolk . The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s . The mill was tailwinded c1920 , and as a result one pair of sails was removed . Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 . One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded .On the death of Alphonso Vincent in 1932 , his son George inherited the property . He lived at the site in an old lorry until his death in 1973 . The mill passed to his daughter , who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries , who intended to convert it into a house . They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration . In 1976 , the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale . Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979 , and plans for restoration were made . The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard , Charles Dolman , Peter Dolman , David Pearce and Chris Seago . The derelict mill and an acre of land cost £ 6 @,@ 000 .
