A defense @-@ appointed expert witness in the field of biomechanics testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward , he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head . He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans , he must have been not only pushed , but must have jumped himself . The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony , claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time , as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies , according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall . The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points .In his closing speech , the State Attorney asked the court to incarcerate Blythe for 5 years , claiming that " even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury . "A Nosek family representative said that based on the witness testimonies , the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible . He continued that he would not be substantiating the requested amount , as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered . He further added that Daniel had died on his father 's birthday , and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work .In his closing word , Blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so .
