Although " Angel of Death " did not enter any charts , it received strong praise from critics in reviews for Reign in Blood . Clay Jarvas of Stylus Magazine noted that the song " smokes the asses of any band playing fast and / or heavy today . Lyrically outlining the horrors to come , while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record : fast , lean and filthy . "Adrien Begrand of PopMatters remarked that " There 's no better song to kick things off than the masterful ' Angel of Death ' , one of the most monumental songs in metal history , where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs , drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded , and bassist / vocalist Tom Araya screams and snarls his tale of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele . "Capitalizing on the publicity generated by the controversy , the band utilized Nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop swastika , during the Seasons in the Abyss period . Hanneman placed SS stickers on his guitar , and wrote " SS @-@ 3 " a song about Reinhard Heydrich , the second in command in the Schutzstaffel organization .
