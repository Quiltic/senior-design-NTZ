Tikal ( / tiˈkäl / ) ( Tik ’ al in modern Mayan orthography ) is the ruins of an ancient city found in a rainforest in Guatemala . Ambrosio Tut , a gum @-@ sapper , reported the ruins to La Gaceta , a Guatemalan newspaper , which named the site Tikal . After the Berlin Academy of Sciences ' magazine republished the report in 1853 , archeologists and treasure hunters began visiting the forest . Today tourism to the site may help protect the rainforest . It is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre @-@ Columbian Maya civilization . It is located in the archaeological region of the Petén Basin in what is now northern Guatemala . Situated in the department of El Petén , the site is part of Guatemala 's Tikal National Park and in 1979 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site .Tikal was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya . Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC , Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period , c . 200 to 900 AD . During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico . There is evidence that Tikal was conquered by Teotihuacan in the 4th century AD . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the 10th century .Tikal is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces .
