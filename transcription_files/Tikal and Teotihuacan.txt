Dynastic rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal . According to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by Yax @-@ Moch @-@ Xoc , perhaps in the 3rd century AD . At the beginning of the Early Classic , power in the Maya region was concentrated at Tikal and Calakmul , in the core of the Maya heartland .Tikal may have benefited from the collapse of the large Preclassic states such as El Mirador . In the Early Classic Tikal rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region , stimulating the development of other nearby Maya cities .The site , however , was often at war and inscriptions tell of alliances and conflict with other Maya states , including Uaxactun , Caracol , Naranjo and Calakmul . The site was defeated at the end of the Early Classic by Caracol , which rose to take Tikal 's place as the paramount center in the southern Maya lowlands . The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between Tikal and its neighbor Uaxactun , with Uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from Tikal .There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD 317 , when Lady Unen Bahlam conducted a katun @-@ ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city .
