The Papa Stour sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England . A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott .The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa Stour and Foula for a while during the late nineteenth century . The writer , folklorist and musician , George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa Stour .It is also the ' Papa ' of Vagaland 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the folksong tradition , as set to music by T.M.Y. Manson . The insistent chorus chant , ' Rowin Foula Doon ! ' , is particularly striking ." Oot bewast da Horn o Papa ,Rowin Foula doon !Owir a hidden piece o water ,Rowin Foula doon !Roond da boat da tide @-@ lumps makkin ,Sunlicht trowe da cloods is brakkin ;We maan geng whaar fish is takkin ,Rowin Foula doon ! "" Rowin Foula doon ! " refers to the fishermens ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of Foula were no longer visible . This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa Stour . The ' tide @-@ lumps ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . The resonant final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o flooers ' across the water . This is an example of Vagaland 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature .
