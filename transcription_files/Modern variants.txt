The classical version of the Nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent . The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate .Strong Lewis or protic acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g. TiCl4 , BF3 , MeSO3H ) . These promoters are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope .Despite the mechanistic possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction . This limits the atom economy of the reaction .The elimination step is not regioselective ; if multiple Î² @-@ hydrogens are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures . This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as arduous separation is typically required .Elimination destroys a potential stereocenter , decreasing the potential usefulness of the reaction .Protonation of the enolate is sometimes not stereoselective , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of epimers .
