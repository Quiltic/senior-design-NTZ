The Nazarov cyclization reaction ( often referred to as simply the Nazarov cyclization ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones . The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed . It was originally discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov ( 1906 – 1957 ) in 1941 while studying the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones .As originally described , the Nazarov cyclization involves the activation of a divinyl ketone using a stoichiometric Lewis acid or protic acid promoter . The key step of the reaction mechanism involves a cationic 4π @-@ electrocyclic ring closure which forms the cyclopentenone product ( See Mechanism below ) . As the reaction has been developed , variants involving substrates other than divinyl ketones and promoters other than Lewis acids have been subsumed under the name Nazarov cyclization provided that they follow a similar mechanistic pathway .The success of the Nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products ( including jasmone , the aflatoxins , and a subclass of prostaglandins ) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis . The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published .
