The mechanism of the classical Nazarov cyclization reaction was first demonstrated experimentally by Shoppe to be an intramolecular electrocyclization and is outlined below . Activation of the ketone by the acid catalyst generates a pentadienyl cation which undergoes a thermally allowed 4π conrotatory electrocyclization as dictated by the Woodward @-@ Hoffman rules . This generates an oxyallyl cation which undergoes an elimination reaction to lose a β @-@ hydrogen . Subsequent tautomerization of the enolate produces the cyclopentenone product .As noted above , variants that deviate from this template are known ; what designates a Nazarov cyclization in particular is the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation . In order to achieve this transformation , the molecule must be in the s @-@ trans / s @-@ trans conformation , placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation . The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate , with α @-@ substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain . Coordination of an electron donating α @-@ substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation .Similarly , β @-@ substitution directed inward restricts the s @-@ trans conformation so severely that E @-@ Z isomerization has been shown to occur in advance of cyclization on a wide range of substrates , yielding the trans cyclopentenone regardless of initial configuration . In this way , the Nazarov cyclization is a rare example of a stereoselective pericyclic reaction , whereas most electrocyclizations are stereospecific . The example below uses triethylsilyl hydride to trap the oxyallyl cation so that no elimination occurs . ( See Interrupted cyclizations below )Along this same vein , allenyl vinyl ketones of the type studied extensively by Marcus Tius of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β @-@ hydrogens , obviating a large amount of steric strain in the s @-@ cis conformer .
