The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the Nazarov cyclization took advantage of the Î² @-@ silicon effect in order to direct the regioselectivity of the elimination step . This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois , Urbana @-@ Champaign in the mid @-@ 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron trichloride to promote the reaction . With bicyclic products , the cis isomer was selected for to varying degrees .The silicon @-@ directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product Silphinene , shown below . The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety , so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether .
