Acting on a report in January 2009 , the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement . The report recognised the sculpture 's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long @-@ term solution . One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre , although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing .In January 2009 , Antony Gormley , creator of the Angel of the North — to which B of the Bang is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , " It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground @-@ breaking work was commissioned . To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council 's nerve . "Despite Gormley 's plea , removal of B of the Bang began in April 2009 . More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm Connell Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment .Although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture 's return , and in early July 2012 the core was sold as scrap for £ 17 @,@ 000 .
