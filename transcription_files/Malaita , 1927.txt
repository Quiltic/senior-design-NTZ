The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the Bolshevik party assumed power in October 1917 . Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ tsarist , anti @-@ Bolshevik White Russian forces . Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting . A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( NREF ) . Awaiting repatriation in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( NRRF ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed .The Royal Australian Navy destroyer HMAS Swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 . Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General , Anton Denikin in South Russia , while several more advised Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia . Later , they also served in Mesopotamia as part of Dunsterforce and the Malleson Mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India , and did little fighting .Although the motivations of those Australian 's that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political . Regardless , they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage , winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers . Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war . Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia .
