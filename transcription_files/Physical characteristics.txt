Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity . The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae 's spectrum . The planet 's existence was announced in January 1997 , together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Boötis .Like 51 Pegasi b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star , closer than Mercury does to our Sun . The planet takes 4 @.@ 617 days to complete an orbit , with a semimajor axis of 0 @.@ 0595 AU .A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . In the case of Upsilon Andromedae b , this lower limit is 68 @.@ 7 % of the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . However , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 @.@ 4 MJ . Coplanarity is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees .
