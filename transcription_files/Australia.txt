The Natives remained in London following the England international . They defeated London Welsh on 18 February , before losing first to Cambridge , then Oxford University . From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh . After a win over Runcorn , there was a defeat to Oldham , played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous . After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March . The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with Hull . Widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists ' last match in northern England .The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain . They eventually played Southern Counties , and beat them 3 – 1 . This was their 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory . The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively , and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell . This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest .
