Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort Moultrie shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William Moultrie for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston . Extensively modified in the years after the battle , it was supplanted by Fort Sumter as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War . In 1876 , to celebrate the centennial , companies from Savannah , Augusta , Macon , Columbia , New York and Boston were invited to Charleston . The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960 , and is now part of Fort Sumter National Monument .A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan 's Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where General Clinton 's soldiers had hoped to cross . The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement .One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel Moultrie . Commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle . Despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory ) . It came to be known as the Moultrie flag or Liberty Flag . When Charleston ( lost to the British in the 1780 siege ) was reclaimed by American forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by General Nathanael Greene .
