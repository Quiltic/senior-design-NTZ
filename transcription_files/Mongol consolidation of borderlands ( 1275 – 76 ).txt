At Beijing , Kublai Khan , who was preparing an invasion of Japan , decided against a war with Pagan â€” for the time being . On 3 March 1273 , he sent a 4 @-@ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the First Secretary to the Board Rites , to Pagan . The delegation carried a letter from the emperor . The letter says :" If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All @-@ Highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with Us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . This will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war , who will be the victor ? Ponder well , O king , Our words . "This time , the Burmese king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . ( The Burmese chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . But both Burmese inscriptional evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . ) At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to Yunnan in due time . The newly formed Yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route .
