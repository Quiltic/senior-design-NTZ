Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface .The Spitzer Space Telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of Upsilon Andromedae b of about 1 @,@ 400 degrees Celsius , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 650 degrees Celsius . The temperature difference has led to speculation that Upsilon Andromedae b is tidal locked with the same side always facing Upsilon Andromedae A.Sudarsky had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted Upsilon Andromedae b to have reflective clouds of silicates and iron in its upper atmosphere . The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiation ; between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a stratosphere of cooler gas . The outer shell of dark , opaque , hot cloud is assumed to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides ( " pM planets " ) , but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet .The planet is unlikely to have large moons , since tidal forces would either eject them from orbit or destroy them on short timescales compared to the age of the system .The planet ( with 51 Pegasi b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by Planetpol . Preliminary results from polarimetric studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @.@ 36 times as large and 0 @.@ 74 times as massive as Jupiter , meaning that the mean density is 0.36g / cm3 . It has a geometric albedo of 0 @.@ 35 in visible light .
