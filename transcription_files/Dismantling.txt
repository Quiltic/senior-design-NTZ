The tip of one of the 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on 6 January 2005 , only six days before the official unveiling . After inspection , the event went ahead as planned .Four months later , in May 2005 , a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose . At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . As a result , some of the joints were re @-@ welded , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement . This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70 % of the spikes ' weights .Despite these modifications , B of the Bang remained fenced off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to ' Get It Sorted ' . In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel .It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . In November 2008 this culminated in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council , the project 's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd , and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd , Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd . The agreement was to pay the council Â£ 1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence .
