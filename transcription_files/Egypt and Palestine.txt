The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914 . During the journey one of the convoy 's naval escorts — HMAS Sydney — engaged and destroyed the German cruiser SMS Emden at the Battle of Cocos on 8 November , in the first ship @-@ to @-@ ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy . Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front , the Australians were instead sent to British @-@ controlled Egypt to pre @-@ empt any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal , and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers .Aiming to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious lodgement at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed .For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . Today , the date of the initial landings , 25 April , is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as Turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war .
