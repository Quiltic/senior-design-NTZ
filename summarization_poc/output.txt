-Uxmal is an ancient Mayan city with a large pyramid
-The pyramid was built in layers and was mostly used for religious purposes
-Arches were made of special cut stones so that if one side collapsed, the other would still stand
-There is a main courtyard with thirteen doors for the upper gods and nine for the lower gods
-The main ball court is badly damaged but it is speculated that it was used by the upper echelon
-Water was kept during the dry season by reservoirs that were underground with one or two holes to the surface
-The main castle is oriented towards where Venus sets in the east, representing the king's relationship to the god
-The water was crystal clear and you could easily see fish swimming
-This one also had two diving platforms that you could jump off of
-Overall it was definitely my most memorable day of the trip
