-Uxmal is an ancient Mayan city that was a major trade center
-The main pyramid was built up three times, and is speculated to be mostly for religious use
-Arches were made of special cut stones that were then filled in so that when one half of the wall collapses or is destroyed, the other side will still stand firm
-The main ball court is badly damaged, but it is speculated that due to its proximity, it was most likely for the upper echelon of the Uxmal peoples
-Canals ran along the streets until it ended in a massive reservoir that held the water from the rainy seasons
-The main castle was built on a massive stone platform which let you look out over the other buildings of the area, and the throne/building was oriented towards where Venus set in the far east
-The water was crystal clear and you could easily see fish swimming
-This one also had two diving platforms that you could jump off of
-Overall it was definitely my most memorable day of the trip.
