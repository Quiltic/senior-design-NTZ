-Urbanization occurred rapidly in the second half of the nineteenth century in the United States for a number of reasons, including new technologies, industrialization, and immigration. -Cities developed their own unique characters based on the core industry that spurred their growth. -Urbanization at the turn of the century was shaped by four key innovations: electric lighting, communication improvements, intracity transportation, and the rise of skyscrapers. -However, rapid urbanization also led to a number of challenges, including concerns over housing and living conditions, transportation, and communication. These issues were often rooted in deep class inequalities, shaped by racial divisions, religious differences, and ethnic strife.

-The equipment for AC power could extend for miles from the power source, making it possible for urban centers to physically cover greater areas. -The factories, electric lights, and telephone networks made urban sprawl possible. The telephone allowed for instant communication over larger distances, and the electric lights increased factory production. -The trolley was invented in 1887, and cable cars were introduced in San Francisco in 1873. The trolley modernized less important industrial centers, such as the southern city of Richmond, Virginia. -The subway system began operating in Boston in 1897, and was quickly followed by New York and other cities.

-The increasing cost of real estate and the need for workers to be close to urban centers led to the development of skyscrapers in the late 1800s. -The first electric elevator was installed in 1889, which made taller buildings possible. -The skyscraper craze led to increased congestion, pollution, crime, and disease in urban centers. - To improve living conditions, cities introduced sewage pumping systems and fire safety measures. - Churches and civic organizations provided relief to the challenges of working-class city life through the social gospel movement. - The settlement house movement of the 1890s provided additional relief to the urban poor.

-The settlement house movement was created by Jane Addams and Lillian Wald in order to help working-class women, particularly those who were immigrants or African American. -The movement spread quickly to other cities, where settlement houses provided relief to working-class women, as well as employment opportunities for women in the field of social work. -The success of the settlement house movement led to pressure for housing laws, child labor laws, and worker’s compensation laws. -Settlement house workers also became influential leaders in the women’s suffrage movement as well as the antiwar movement during World War I. -The Great Migration was a large exodus of African Americans from the rural South to the urban Northeast and Upper Midwest in the early twentieth century. -The migration was caused by a combination of “push” and “pull” factors, including racial violence and discrimination in the South, and the promise of new opportunities in the North.

-Americans fled to northern and midwestern cities to escape the dangers of the South (push factors) -African Americans were attracted to these cities by factors such as job opportunities and the chance to vote (pull factors) -Many African Americans lack the funds to move north, so factory owners and other businesses that sought cheap labor assisted the migration -African Americans typically found housing to be more available in the North, but they also faced higher costs of living, overcrowding, and unsanitary conditions -Racial discrimination did not end at the Mason-Dixon Line, and African Americans also faced discrimination from European immigrants -The North offered greater educational opportunities and more expansive personal freedoms to African Americans

-In the late 1800s, there was a sharp increase in immigration from southern and eastern European countries -This was due to a combination of "push" and "pull" factors, such as poverty, religious persecution, and the promise of work -Most immigrants settled in port towns, where they arrived, and many were unable to speak English -This led to the development of ethnic enclaves within cities, where immigrants could find everything from familiar food to language newspapers -The demographic shift at the turn of the century was later confirmed by the Dillingham Commission, which reinforced the idea that these immigrants were discriminated against because they looked and acted differently

-New immigrants to the US in the late 1800s were easily identifiable by their differences in dress, food, and religion, and were thus easy targets for hatred and discrimination. -Josiah Strong's book "Our Country" helped to fuel the discrimination against immigrants, and the American Protective Association successfully lobbied for legislation curbing immigration. -Settlement houses and religious and civic organizations attempted to provide support to working-class city dwellers, but life in the city was still chaotic. -Machine politics was one way that working-class urban Americans coped with the challenges of urban life.

-The machine political system was a way for citizens to get their needs met in exchange for political support -One example of a machine political system was Tammany Hall in New York, run by machine boss William Tweed -Machine political systems were corrupt, but they provided timely solutions for citizens -Other large cities made use of political machines as well -Working-class residents also found relief in the diverse and omnipresent offerings of popular culture and entertainment in and around cities -For example, Coney Island on the Brooklyn shoreline consisted of several different amusement parks, the first of which opened in 1895 -The treatment of animals in many acts at Coney Island and other public amusement parks drew the attention of middle-class reformers such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals -Another common form of popular entertainment was vaudeville—large stage variety shows that included everything from singing, dancing, and comedy acts to live animals and magic -In addition to live theater shows, it was primarily working-class citizens who enjoyed the advent of the nickelodeon, a forerunner to the movie theater

-The rise of movie theaters in the early 1900s was due in part to a vaudeville performers' strike. -Professional baseball teams became popular in the late 1800s as a way for newly relocated Americans and immigrants of diverse backgrounds to develop a unified civic identity. -The American financial elite did not need to crowd into cities to find work, but as urban centers were vital business cores, those who worked in that world wished to remain close to the action. -Wealthy citizens seldom attended what they considered the crass entertainment of the working class. Instead of amusement parks and baseball games, urban elites sought out more refined pastimes that underscored their knowledge of art and culture, preferring classical music concerts, fine art collections, and social gatherings with their peers. -As new opportunities for the middle class threatened the austerity of upper-class citizens, wealthier Americans sought unique ways to further set themselves apart in society. These included more expensive excursions, such as vacations in Newport, Rhode Island, winter relocation to sunny Florida, and frequent trips aboard steamships to Europe.

-The wealthy class in the late 1800s chose to remain in cities to stay close to business transactions -The middle class responded to urban challenges by escaping to the suburbs -Suburbanization was made possible by the introduction of the electric railway and Henry Ford's popularization of the automobile -Social norms of the day encouraged middle-class women to take pride in creating a positive home environment -Some women of the middle class found paths to college, which opened up new opportunities to work outside the home

-The children of middle-class parents had opportunities for education and advancement that would solidify their position in the middle class. -Public school enrollment exploded at this time, with the number of students attending public school tripling from seven million in 1870 to twenty-one million in 1920. -High schools also grew at this time, from one hundred high schools nationally in 1860 to over six thousand by 1900. -The federal government supported the growth of higher education with the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. -Land-grant colleges stood in contrast to the expensive, private Ivy League universities such as Harvard and Yale, which still catered to the elite. -College curricula also changed at this time. Students grew less likely to take traditional liberal arts classes in rhetoric, philosophy, and foreign language, and instead focused on preparing for the modern work world. -As the U.S. population became increasingly centered in urban areas while the century drew to a close, questions about the quality of city life—particularly with regard to issues of aesthetics, crime, and poverty—quickly consumed many reformers’ minds. -Those middle-class and wealthier urbanites who enjoyed the costlier amenities presented by city life—including theaters, restaurants, and shopping—were free to escape to the suburbs, leaving behind the poorer working classes living in squalor and unsanitary conditions. -Through the City Beautiful movement, leaders such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Daniel Burnham sought to champion middle- and upper-class progressive reforms.

-The "White City" set the stage for American urban city planning for the next generation, beginning in 1901 with the modernization of Washington, DC. -This model encouraged city planners to consider three principal tenets: -First, create larger park areas inside cities; -Second, build wider boulevards to decrease traffic congestion and allow for lines of trees and other greenery between lanes; -And third, add more suburbs in order to mitigate congested living in the city itself. -As each city adapted these principles in various ways, the City Beautiful movement became a cornerstone of urban development well into the twentieth century.

-Pragmatism is an American philosophy that holds that the truth about American society can only be found by experimenting with different ideas and perspectives, rather than assuming that there is truth in old, previously accepted models. -John Dewey built on the idea of pragmatism to create a theory of instrumentalism, which advocated the use of education in the search for truth. -Dewey believed that education, specifically observation and change through the scientific method, was the best tool by which to reform and improve American society as it continued to grow ever more complex. -The new medium of photography, popularized by Riis, as well as novels and other forms of art, embraced realism in order to portray vignettes from real life. -Visual artists such as George Bellows, Edward Hopper, and Robert Henri, among others, formed the Ashcan School of Art, which was interested primarily in depicting the urban lifestyle. -Novelists and journalists also popularized realism in literary works. Authors such as Stephen Crane and Rebecca Harding Davis embodied this popular style. -Mark Twain also sought realism in his books, whether it was the reality of the pioneer spirit, seen in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, or the issue of corruption in The Gilded Age. -Some authors, such as Jack London, embraced a school of thought called naturalism, which concluded that the laws of nature and the natural world were the only truly relevant laws governing humanity. -Kate Chopin sought to portray a realistic view of women’s lives in late nineteenth-century America, thus paving the way for more explicit feminist literature in generations to come. -In her work Desiree’s Baby, Chopin specifically explores the Creole community of her native Louisiana in depths that exposed the reality of racism in a manner seldom seen in literature of the time. -African American poet, playwright, and novelist of the realist period, Paul Laurence Dunbar dealt with issues of race at a time when most reform-minded Americans preferred to focus on other issues.

-Paul Laurence Dunbar was an African American writer who richly portrayed the successes and struggles of African American life. -Dunbar initially struggled to find the financial support needed to develop a full-time literary career, but later found success with the help of literary critic and Atlantic Monthly editor William Dean Howells. -Dunbar's writing gave insights into a world that was not necessarily familiar to many Americans, and served to give hidden communities a sense of voice. -Edward Bellamy's 1888 novel Looking Backward, 2000-1887 was a popular bestseller that portrayed a utopian America in the year 2000, and influenced many people who felt that the industrial age was sending the country in the wrong direction. -Henry George's 1879 work Progress and Poverty criticized the inequality found in an industrial economy, and Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) lamented that capitalism created a middle class more preoccupied with its own comfort and consumption than with maximizing production.
